## Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship
### by Robert C. Martin

_**Kaizen**_ is a Japanese term that captures the concept of continuously making many small improvements.

**Take responsibility:** Don't blame all the problems on a vendor, a programming language, management or your coworkers. Any and all of these may play a role, but it is up to _you_ to provide solutions, not excuses.

Don't leave "**broken windows**" unrepaired. Fix each one as soon as it is discovered. If there is insuffecient time to fix it properly, then _board it up_. (...) **Don't let entropy win**.

Your **knowledge** and **experience** are your most important professional assets. Unfortunately, they're _**expiring assets**_.
