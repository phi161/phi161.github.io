# MVC

Apple's MVC is not the same with _traditional_ MVC, the main difference being that Apple does __not__ allow the direct connection between view and model (this is assigned to the controller instead, which acts as the mediator). Whenever a cell updates itself using a model reference, the MVC pattern breaks (since this communication should have been done by the controller).

# MVVM

* [Github tag: mvvm-architecture](https://github.com/topics/mvvm-architecture?l=swift)
* [Taming Great Complexity: MVVM, Coordinators and RxSwift](https://blog.uptech.team/taming-great-complexity-mvvm-coordinators-and-rxswift-8daf8a76e7fd)
* [MVVM with ReactiveCocoa 3, in Swift](http://www.martinrichter.net/blog/2015/08/12/mvvm-with-reactivecocoa-3-in-swift/). Series, one post is about passing data among views.


# Coordinators / Routing

* **2020.01** [Using Type Erasure to Build a Dependency Injecting Routing Framework in Swift](https://swiftrocks.com/using-type-erasure-to-build-a-dependency-injector-in-swift.html)
* **2019.12** [Routing for iOS: universal navigation without rewriting the app](https://badootech.badoo.com/routing-for-ios-universal-navigation-without-rewriting-the-app-215b52a37cf2)
* [XCoordinator](https://github.com/quickbirdstudios/XCoordinator) on GitHub
* [Advanced coordinators in iOS](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/articles/175/advanced-coordinator-pattern-tutorial-ios) covers the following:
    1. How and when do you use child coordinators?
    1. How do you handle moving back from a navigation controller?
    1. How do you pass data between view controllers?
    1. How do you use tab bar controllers with coordinators?
    1. How do you handle segues?
    1. How do you use protocols or closures instead?
* [Navigation Problem](http://kean.github.io/post/navigation-problem) and [Controller Hierarchies](https://sandofsky.com/blog/controller-hierarchies.html) challenge the need for coordinators, describing other "pure" UIKit alternatives.
* [Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/)
* [The Coordinator Pattern](https://www.iamsim.me/the-coordinator-pattern/)  
Simple implementation with an [example gist](https://gist.github.com/simme/ea0918d534f13ace3445e84ec043ed99). Good starting point.
* Coordinators Essential tutorial: [part I](https://medium.com/blacklane-engineering/coordinators-essential-tutorial-part-i-376c836e9ba7) & [part II](https://medium.com/@panovdev/coordinators-essential-tutorial-part-ii-b5ab3eb4a74)  
Lengthy and more advanced, comes with [example project](https://github.com/AndreyPanov/ApplicationCoordinator)
* [An iOS Coordinator Pattern](https://will.townsend.io/2016/an-ios-coordinator-pattern)  
Uses a (not very nice) `Services` struct and comes with [Github example](https://github.com/wtsnz/Coordinator-Example)
* [MVC-C Â· Injecting Coordinator pattern in UIKit](http://aplus.rs/2017/mvc-c-injecting-coordinator-pattern-in-uikit/)  
Uses the `UIResponder` chain and associated objects to achieve communication among coordinators. [Another article](http://aplus.rs/2018/coordinator-missing-pattern-uikit/) from the same author.
* [Swift - Coordinators](http://skyefreeman.io/programming/2016/02/23/playing_with_app_coordinators.html)  
Starts even before setting the window's `rootViewController`
* [Navigation coordinators](http://irace.me/navigation-coordinators) _Hereâ€™s the problem: while this works great so long as the user keeps moving forward through our onboarding flow, what would happen if they tapped the navigation controllerâ€™s back button?_ (more links about "back" in [this issue](https://github.com/ReSwift/ReSwift-Router/issues/17)).
