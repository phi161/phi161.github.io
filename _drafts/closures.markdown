# Notes

## Capture Lists

* *The lesson [here](https://www.objc.io/blog/2018/04/03/caputure-lists/) is to consider carefully what you actually need to capture in your closure. Do you really need a reference to self? Or do you just need a reference to an object on self? If you can capture something more specific, you can often avoid dealing with weak or unowned references.*
* [This code](https://www.raywenderlich.com/762435-swift-interview-questions-and-answers):

```
var thing = "cars"

let closure = { [thing] in
  print("I love \(thing)")
}

thing = "airplanes"

closure()
```
will print `I love cars`: *The capture list creates a copy of `thing` when you declare the closure. This means that captured value doesn't change even if you assign a new value to `thing`*.
