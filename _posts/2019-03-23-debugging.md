# Logging

* **2019.04** [Migrating to Unified Logging: Console and Instruments](https://www.raywenderlich.com/605079-migrating-to-unified-logging-console-and-instruments)
* **2018.09** [Migrating to Unified Logging, Swift Edition](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/migrating-to-unified-logging-swift-edition/)
* [XCGLogger](https://github.com/DaveWoodCom/XCGLogger) allows you to log details to the console (and optionally a file, or other custom destinations), just like you would have with NSLog() or print(), but with additional information, such as the date, function name, filename and line number.
* [NSLogger](https://github.com/fpillet/NSLogger) is a high performance logging utility which displays traces emitted by client applications running on macOS, iOS and Android. It replaces traditional console logging traces (NSLog(), Java Log).
