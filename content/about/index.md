My name is Fotis and I am a Software Engineer based in Athens, Greece.

During my career I have worked as an independent developer as well as a team leader and mentor. I created some simple apps but was also involved in large and complicated projects that require effective management and communication across teams of various disciplines. Regardless of the projectâ€™s nature and size, I always appreciate clean code, thoughtful design choices and aim for higher quality.
