My name is Fotis and I am a software engineer based in Athens, Greece.  

During my career I have worked as an independent developer as well as a team leader and mentor. I created some simple apps but was also involved in large and complicated projects that require effective management and communication across teams of various disciplines. Regardless of the project's nature and size, I always appreciate clean code, thoughtful design choices and aim for higher quality.

I enjoy the social aspects of programming and do my best to contribute back to the iOS community through [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/289501/phi) and [Github](https://github.com/phi161). I also started the [CocoaHeads Chapter](https://www.meetup.com/CocoaHeads-Shanghai/) in Shanghai which outreached 400 members in less than two years.
